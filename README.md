# ML-Implementation-on-Medicare-services-using-Python

Project Overview
This project applies Machine Learning techniques to analyze and predict patterns in Medicare services data. The goal is to improve healthcare efficiency, optimize service costs, and enhance patient care. The project includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

Project Workflow
Data Preprocessing – Cleaning and preparing Medicare dataset.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Understanding trends and distributions.
Feature Engineering – Selecting relevant attributes for ML models.
Model Training – Implementing algorithms like Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest.
Evaluation – Assessing model accuracy using performance metrics.
Visualization – Presenting insights with plots and charts.
